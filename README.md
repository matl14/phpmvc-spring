Spring
=========

My project. Instructions were to make a Stack Overflow-inspired website with an individually chosen and here is mine. Submitted for BTH University 30 January, 2015 1 a.m.

Following is my contribution and how you can set it up for yourself. 

First off, download from this page then follow further:

Settings after download:
=========

* The folder "data" under webroot and its .db-file must be writable. 
* The folder "anax-grid" under webroot/css must be writable. 

Changes
---------
As with all of the content on here, please change the content in the .db file under that same "data" folder and add your own.
